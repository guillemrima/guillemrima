<h1>👋 Hello there! Welcome to my Github profile!</h1>

<p>👨‍💻 My name is Guillem and I am a Front-end developer. I love working with Javascript, Typescript, SASS and React to create beautiful and responsive web applications.</p>

<p>🔍 Currently, I am in search of new employment opportunities, and I am excited to collaborate on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer.</p>
